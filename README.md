### Job interview Android application using Kotlin

An app that contacts an API, fetches its data and displays in a list, detailed view forms.

Only had a few hours a day to finish this up for a few days.

### Some of notible information:
* Made in kotlin;
* Animations for activities, everything else;
* Loading progress bar;
* 2 Activities + 1 fragment for detailed view;
* Vibrations applied to where they are needed;
* Image loading using Glide library;
* API handling using retrofit;
* JSON parsing using GSON;
* List has recycler view adapter with swipe down to refresh functionality
* MVP: attempted to follow MVP, partially converted to it, lack of time was an issue;

### Currently the app looks like this:
